== Presentation

*{GX_TITLE}* is a shell tool that makes it easy to perform recurring actions with *Git* on a daily basis.

image::doc/img/overview.png[]

It allows :

* Display in the *shell prompt* the project status with *Git information*.
* Set up *documented aliases* for recurring *Git* actions.
* Have a *commit message formatter* (without `prepare-commit-msg` hook) inspired by the https://www.conventionalcommits.org/[conventional commits].
* Provide comprehensive and quickly accessible *documentation in the shell*.
* Customise *options globally or by project*.
* Ensure stability with *unit tests*.

[TIP]
====
*{GX_TITLE}* does not alter the default operation of *Git* commands: all *Git* commands retain their original behaviour.
====

The features of *{GX_TITLE}* are based on my experiments with hundreds of aliases, which you can find on my Gist https://gist.github.com/jprivet-dev/09912ca4188a4ba3c610d7f61c200c38[Git and Bash aliases defined and documented in a single `.bash_aliases` file, with Git auto-completion].
