== Presentation

*{GX_TITLE}* is a shell tool that makes it easy to perform recurring actions with *Git* on a daily basis.

It allows :

* Display in the *shell prompt* the project status with *Git information*.
* Set up *documented aliases* for recurring Git actions.
* Have a *commit message formatter* (without `prepare-commit-msg` hook) inspired by the https://www.conventionalcommits.org/[conventional commits].
* Provide comprehensive and quickly accessible *documentation in the shell*.
* Customise *options globally or by project*.
* Ensure stability with *unit tests*.

== Documentation

Find all the information on installation and configuration in the https://www.jprivet.dev/git-xtended[*{GX_TITLE}* documentation].

== Searches on efficient Git and Bash aliases

The features of Git Xtended are based on my research on Git and Bash aliases, which you can find on my gist https://gist.github.com/jprivet-dev/09912ca4188a4ba3c610d7f61c200c38[Git and Bash aliases defined and documented in a single `.bash_aliases` file, with Git auto-completion]
